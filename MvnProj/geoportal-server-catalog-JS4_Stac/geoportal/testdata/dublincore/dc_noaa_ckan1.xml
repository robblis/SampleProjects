Vector points and lines in this data set represent the human-use site locations and political boundaries.  Location-specific type and source information is stored in relational data tables (described below) designed to be used in conjunction with this spatial data layer.This data set comprises a portion of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data for Virginia.  ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil.  The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources.  See also the MGT (Management Area Polygons) data layer, part of the larger Virginia ESI database, for additional human-use information.</dc:description><dct:abstract>This data set contains data for airports, aquaculture sites, beaches, boat ramps, coast guard stations, heliports, dams, marinas, water intakes, bridges, and state boundaries for Virginia.
